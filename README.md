# AI Desktop Chatcat
Do humans dream of cyber cats?

<img src="idling.gif" alt="demo"/>

This project creates a desktop kitty that sleeps, wanders around, keeps you company, and replies to your messages.

## Features
- a basic tkinter app
- randomly chooses actions
- animation/ sprite management
- openai integration

## Improvements 
- improve gui for cat interaction
- more complex behaviors (e.g., eating, dying(purrhaps?), responding to music, being able to control the computer via terminal/cmd)
- adding more skins for the cat (can be done by AI as well)
- onedrive

## Run Instructions
- set your openai api key as your environment variable with a name called "OPENAI_API_KEY"
- open the root folder where the project is installed and run py ``main.py``
- press key ~ to activate voice input

## Contributions
- this project is based off the open source project [Desktop Cat](https://github.com/1ilit/Desktop-Cat)
- Ryan and Sihao
